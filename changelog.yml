    Wrapping constructor types :tada: (@flash-gordon)

      Constructor blocks can have a second argument.
      The second argument is the underlying type itself:
      ```ruby
      age_from_year = Dry::Types['coercible.integer'].constructor do |input, type|
        Date.today.year - type.(input)
      end
      age_from_year.('2000') # => 21
      ```
      With wrapping constructors you have control over "type application". You can even
      run it more than once:
      ```ruby
      inc = Dry::Types['integer'].constructor(&:succ)
      inc2x = inc.constructor { _2.(_2.(_2.(_1))) }
      inc2x.(10) # => 13
      ```
  - |-
    Fallbacks :tada: (@flash-gordon)

      ```ruby
      age = Dry::Types['coercible.ineger'].fallback(18)
      age.('10') # => 10
      age.('20') # => 20
      age.('abc') # => 18
      ```

      Fallbacks are different from default values: the later will be evaluated
      only when *no input* provided.

      Under the hood, `.fallback` creates a wrapping constructor.
  - '`params.string` as an alias for `strict.string`. This addition should be non-breaking (@flash-gordon)'

      # Using new builder
      type = Dry::Types['integer'].or(-273)
      type.(:invalid) # => -273

    Inferring predicates from class names is deprecated. It's very unlikely your code depends on it,
      however, if it does, you'll get an exception with instructions. (@flash-gordon)

      ```ruby
      Dry::Types::PredicateInferrer::Compiler.infer_predicate_by_class_name false

      Otherwise, enable it explicitly:

      ```ruby

      ```

  - Attempting to use non-symbol keys in hash schemas raises an error. We always supported
    only symbols as keys but there was no check, now it'll throw an argument error.
    If you want to convert strings to symbols, use `Hash#with_key_transform` (flash-gordon)
  - Params and JSON types accept Time/Date/Datetime instances and boolean values.
    This can be useful in tests but we discourage you from relying on this behavior
    in production code. For example, building structs with `Params` types is considered
    a smell. There are dedicated tools for coercion, namely dry-schema and dry-validation.

      # => [[[:str?], [:int?]]]

      Note that the API of the predicate inferrer can change in the stable version, it's dictated by the needs of dry-schema so it should be considered as semi-stable. If you depend on it, write specs covering the desired behavior. Another option is copy-and-paste the whole thing to your project.

    [BREAKING] Behavior of built-in constructor types was changed to be more strict. They will always raise an error on failed coercion (flash-gordon)
      Compare:

      ```ruby
      # 0.15.0
      Types::Params::Integer.('foo')
      # => "foo"

      # 1.0.0
      Types::Params::Integer.('foo')
      # => Dry::Types::CoercionError: invalid value for Integer(): "foo"
      ```

      To handle coercion errors `Type#call` now yields a block:

      ```ruby
      Types::Params::Integer.('foo') { :invalid } # => :invalid
      ```

      This makes work with coercions more straightforward and way faster.
  - "[BREAKING] Safe types were renamed to Lax, this name better serves their purpose.
    The previous name is available but prints a warning (flash-gordon)"
  - "[BREAKING] Metadata is now pushed down to the decorated type. It is not likely
    you will notice a difference but this a breaking change that enables some use
    cases in rom related to the usage of default types in relations (flash-gordon)"
  - Nominal types are now completely unconstrained. This fixes some inconsistencies
    when using them with constraints. `Nominal#try` will always return a successful
    result, for the previous behavior use `Nominal#try_coerce` or switch to strict
    types with passing a block to `#call` (flash-gordon)

    API for custom constructor types was enhanced. If you pass your own callable to `.constructor` it can have a block in its signature. If a block is passed, you must call it on failed coercion, otherwise raise a type coercion error (flash-gordon)
      Example:
      ```ruby
      proc do |input, &block|
        if input.is_a? String
          Integer(input, 10)
        else
          Integer(input)

          )
        end

    Hash schemas were rewritten. The old API is still around but is going to be deprecated and removed before 1.0. The new API is simpler and more flexible. Instead of having a bunch of predefined schemas you can build your own by combining the following methods:

      1. `Schema#with_key_transform`—transforms keys of input hashes, for things like symbolizing etc.
      2. `Schema#strict`—makes a schema intolerant to unknown keys.
      3. `Hash#with_type_transform`—transforms member types with an arbitrary block. For instance,

      ```ruby
      optional_keys = Types::Hash.with_type_transform { |t, _key| t.optional }
      schema = optional_keys.schema(name: 'strict.string', age: 'strict.int')
      schema.(name: "Jane", age: nil) # => {name: "Jane", age: nil}
      ```

      Note that by default all keys are required, if a key is expected to be absent, add to the corresponding type's meta `omittable: true`:

      ```ruby
      intolerant = Types::Hash.schema(name: Types::Strict::String)
      intolerant[{}] # => Dry::Types::MissingKeyError
      tolerant = Types::Hash.schema(name: Types::Strict::String.meta(omittable: true))
      tolerant[{}] # => {}
      tolerant_with_default = Types::Hash.schema(name: Types::Strict::String.meta(omittable: true).default("John"))
      tolerant[{}] # => {name: "John"}
      ```

      The new API is composable in a natural way:

      ```ruby
      TOLERANT = Types::Hash.with_type_transform { |t| t.meta(omittable: true) }.freeze
      user = TOLERANT.schema(name: 'strict.string', age: 'strict.int')
      user.(name: "Jane") # => {name: "Jane"}

      TOLERANT_SYMBOLIZED = TOLERANT.with_key_transform(&:to_sym)
      user_sym = TOLERANT_SYMBOLIZED.schema(name: 'strict.string', age: 'strict.int')
      user_sym.("name" => "Jane") # => {name: "Jane"}
      ```

    `Types.Strict` is an alias for `Types.Instance` (flash-gordon)
      ```ruby
      strict_range = Types.Strict(Range)
      strict_range == Types.Instance(Range) # => true
      ```
  - "`Enum#include?` is an alias to `Enum#valid?` (d-Pixie + flash-gordon)"
  - "`Range` was added (GustavoCaso)"
  - |-
    `Array` types filter out `Undefined` values, if you have an array type with a constructor type as its member, the constructor now can return `Dry::Types::Undefined` to indicate empty value:
      ```ruby
      filter_empty_strings = Types::Strict::Array.of(
        Types::Strict::String.constructor { |input|
          input.to_s.yield_self { |s| s.empty? ? Dry::Types::Undefined : s }
        }
      )
      filter_empty_strings.(["John", nil, "", "Jane"]) # => ["John", "Jane"]
      ```
  - |-
    `Types::Map` was added for homogeneous hashes, when only types of keys and values are known in advance, not specific key names (fledman + flash-gordon)
      ```ruby
        int_to_string = Types::Hash.map('strict.integer', 'strict.string')
        int_to_string[0 => 'foo'] # => { 0 => "foo" }
        int_to_string[0 => 1] # Dry::Types::MapError: input value 1 for key 0 is invalid: type?(String, 1)
      ```
  - |-
    Enum supports mappings (bolshakov + flash-gordon)
      ```ruby
      dict = Types::Strict::String.enum('draft' => 0, 'published' => 10, 'archived' => 20)
      dict['published'] # => 'published'
      dict[10] # => 'published'
      ```
