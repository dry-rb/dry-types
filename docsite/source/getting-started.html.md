### Using dry-types in your application

1. Make the base types available to your application by defining your own module built from `Dry.Types()`:

    ```ruby
    Types = Dry.Types()
    ```

2. Reload the environment, & enter `Types::Coercible::String` in your ruby console to confirm it worked:

    ``` ruby
    Types::Coercible::String
    # => #<Dry::Types[Constructor<Nominal<String> fn=Kernel.String>]>
    ```

### Creating your first type

1. Define a struct's types by passing the name & type to the `attribute` method:

    ```ruby
    class User < Dry::Struct
      attribute :name, Types::String
    end
    ```

2. Define [Custom Types](docs::custom-types) in your types module, then pass the name & type to `attribute`:

    ```ruby
    Types = Dry.Types()

    module Types
      Email = String.constrained(format: /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-]+(\.[a-z]+)*\.[a-z]+\z/i)
      Age = Integer.constrained(gt: 18)
    end

    class User < Dry::Struct
      attribute :name, Types::String
      attribute :email, Types::Email
      attribute :age, Types::Age
    end
    ```

3. Use a `Dry::Struct` as a type:

    ```ruby
    class Message < Dry::Struct
      attribute :body, Types::String
      attribute :to, User
    end
    ```
